# Basic Syntax in Python

## Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Understanding the basic syntax is the first step to writing Python programs, making it ideal for non-developers starting their coding journey.

## Key Concepts
- **Comments**: Add notes or explanations using `#` for single-line comments.
- **Print Statement**: Output text or variables with `print("Hello, World!")`.
- **Indentation**: Python uses indentation (usually 4 spaces) to define code blocks.
- **Basic Operators**: Perform operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

## Examples
```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!

# Indentation example
if True:
    print("This is indented")  # Output: This is indented

# Basic operators
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)  # Output: 15
print(a * b)  # Output: 50
```

## Exercises
In `exercises.py`, try the following:
1. Print a welcome message with your name.
2. Use comments to explain a simple calculation (e.g., adding two numbers).
3. Experiment with different operators and print the results.

## Project
In `project.py`, create a program that asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting, such as "Welcome to Python, [Name]!".
