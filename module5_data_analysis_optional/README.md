# Module 5: Introduction to Data Analysis (Optional)

## Introduction

In this optional module, you will learn the basics of data analysis with Python using the pandas library. You will also learn how to visualize data using matplotlib.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to pandas for data manipulation (dataframes, series)
- Basic data operations (filtering, sorting, grouping)
- Simple data visualization using matplotlib (e.g., bar charts, line graphs)

## Exercises

Complete the exercises in [exercises.py](exercises.py) to practice data analysis. The exercises include:
- Loading and manipulating data with pandas
- Creating simple visualizations with matplotlib

## Project

Analyze a dataset of sales data and create a bar chart to visualize sales by region in [project.py](project.py). You will need to:
- Load the sales data from a CSV file
- Use pandas to analyze the data (e.g., calculate total sales per region)
- Create a bar chart using matplotlib to visualize the results
