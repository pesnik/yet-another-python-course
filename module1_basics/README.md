# Module 1: Python Basics

## Introduction

In this module, you will learn the fundamental concepts of Python programming. By the end, you will be able to write simple Python programs, understand basic syntax, and work with variables, data types, operators, control flow, and loops.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to Python and programming concepts
- Variables and data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Control flow (if statements, else, elif)
- Loops (for loops, while loops)

## Exercises

Complete the exercises in [exercises.py](exercises.py) to practice the concepts learned in this module. The exercises include:
- Simple calculations using variables and operators
- Writing conditional statements to make decisions
- Using loops to repeat actions

## Project

Apply your knowledge by completing the project in [project.py](project.py): Write a program to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping list. You will need to:
- Define a list of items and their prices
- Use a loop to calculate the total cost
- Print the total cost
