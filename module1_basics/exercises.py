        # ðŸš€ Liftoff Countdown: The Story Behind the Numbers

        When you think of a rocket launch, what's the first thing that comes to mind?

        **"10... 9... 8... 7..."** â€” the classic **reverse countdown**!
        But did you know this tradition started in the **movies** before it became a real-life NASA staple?

        ### ðŸŽ¬ The Origin Story

        The reverse countdown was popularized in Fritz Langâ€™s 1929 sci-fi film *Woman in the Moon*, where it added dramatic tension. NASA adopted it later â€” not for the drama, but to build precision and coordination in rocket launches.
