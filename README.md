# Yet Another Python Course

Welcome to Yet Another Python Course! This course is designed for non-developer professionals who want to learn Python from scratch. It focuses on practical skills that can enhance your productivity in various professional roles.

## Course Overview
This course is structured into modules, each focusing on specific Python concepts and their practical applications. The course is interactive, with hands-on exercises and projects to reinforce learning.

## Syllabus
Below is the detailed syllabus outlining the modules and topics covered in the course:

- **[Module 1: Python Basics](#module-1-python-basics)**
  - Introduction to Python and programming concepts
  - Variables and data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
  - Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
  - Control flow (if statements, else, elif)
  - Loops (for loops, while loops)
  - **Exercises**: Simple calculations, conditional statements, loop-based tasks
  - **Project**: Write a program to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping list

- **[Module 2: Functions and Data Structures](#module-2-functions-and-data-structures)**
  - Functions (defining, calling, parameters, return values)
  - Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
  - Operations on data structures (slicing, appending, iterating)
  - **Exercises**: Create functions for common tasks, manipulate lists and dictionaries
  - **Project**: Build a simple contact list application using dictionaries

- **[Module 3: File Handling and Automation](#module-3-file-handling-and-automation)**
  - Reading and writing text files, CSV files, and JSON data
  - Working with directories and file paths (using `os` module)
  - Basic automation tasks (e.g., renaming files, copying files)
  - **Exercises**: Read/write files, automate file operations
  - **Project**: Automate renaming files in a folder based on a pattern

- **[Module 4: Web Scraping and APIs](#module-4-web-scraping-and-apis)**
  - Introduction to web scraping using BeautifulSoup
  - Working with APIs (making HTTP requests, parsing JSON responses)
  - **Exercises**: Extract data from a website, fetch data from a public API
  - **Project**: Scrape weather data from a website and save it to a CSV file

- **[Module 5: Introduction to Data Analysis (Optional)](#module-5-introduction-to-data-analysis-optional)**
  - Introduction to pandas for data manipulation (dataframes, series)
  - Basic data operations (filtering, sorting, grouping)
  - Simple data visualization using matplotlib (e.g., bar charts, line graphs)
  - **Exercises**: Clean and analyze a small dataset
  - **Project**: Analyze a dataset of sales data and create a bar chart to visualize sales by region

## How to Use This Repository
- Each module has its own folder (e.g., `module1_basics/`, `module2_functions_data_structures/`) containing:
  - A `README.md` with detailed explanations and examples.
  - `exercises.ipynb` for interactive exercises (Jupyter notebook).
  - `project.ipynb` for hands-on projects.
- Exercises and projects can be run on Google Colab or locally (see [setup.md](setup.md) for local setup instructions).
