Future trails may include specialized topics like data analysis or web developmentâ€”stay tuned!

## How to Get Started

1. **Choose Your Trail**:  
   - Start with **Trail 1: Python Essentials** if you're new to Python or want a quick overview.  
   - Move to **Trail 2: Python Exploration** for a deeper, more comprehensive learning experience.

2. **Access the Trails**:  
   Each trail is housed in its own branch. Use the following commands to switch to the desired trail:
