# Yet Another Python Course: Python Developer Roadmap

## Welcome to the Course!

Welcome to **Yet Another Python Course**, a hands-on learning journey designed for non-developer professionals to master Python programming. This repository, follows the [Python Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) to guide you from beginner to advanced skills. Whether you’re automating tasks, analyzing data, or exploring web development, this course offers practical, interactive lessons using [Marimo notebooks](https://docs.marimo.io/).

## Course Overview

This course is tailored for non-developers, such as analysts, administrators, or project managers, who want to leverage Python for real-world applications. It’s structured into three categories, mirroring the Python Developer Roadmap:

- **Basic**: Master foundational concepts like syntax, variables, and data structures.
- **Intermediate**: Build on basics with topics like object-oriented programming and sorting algorithms.
- **Advanced**: Explore optional advanced topics like web frameworks and asynchronous programming.

Each module includes:
- A `README.md` with explanations, examples, and resources.
- `exercises.py`: Interactive Marimo notebooks for practice.
- `project.py`: Small projects to apply your skills.

## Learning Objectives

- Write Python programs using core syntax and data structures.
- Create reusable code with functions, modules, and classes.
- Automate tasks like file handling or API interactions.
- Manage Python libraries and environments.
- (Optional) Build web apps or perform testing and asynchronous tasks.

```

- **basic/**: 10 modules for foundational skills (e.g., `lists`, `conditionals`).
- **intermediate/**: 8 modules for deeper concepts (e.g., `decorators`, `modules`).
- **advanced/**: 6 optional modules for advanced topics (e.g., `testing`, `asynchronous`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A computer with internet access.
- Basic familiarity with a text editor (e.g., VS Code).
- No prior programming experience required.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone -b trail2-python-exploration https://github.com/pesnik/yet-another-python-course.git
   cd yet-another-python-course
   ```

2. **Install Python**:
   Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a package manager:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install python
   # On Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install python3
   ```

3. **Install Marimo**:
   Marimo powers our interactive notebooks. Install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install marimo
   ```

4. **Verify Setup**:
   Test Marimo with a sample notebook:
   ```bash
   marimo edit basic/basic_syntax/exercises.py
   ```

### Usage
1. **Explore Modules**:
   Start with the `basic` folder. Read the `README.md` in each module (e.g., `basic/basic_syntax/README.md`) for explanations and resources.

2. **Run Exercises**:
   Open exercises in Marimo’s editor:
   ```bash
   marimo edit basic/lists/exercises.py
   ```
   Or run as an app (hiding code):
   ```bash
   marimo run basic/lists/exercises.py
   ```

3. **Complete Projects**:
   Apply your skills in `project.py` files (e.g., build a to-do list in `basic/lists/project.py`).

4. **Progress Through Categories**:
   Move from `basic` to `intermediate`, and explore `advanced` modules if desired. Advanced topics are optional for deeper learning.
