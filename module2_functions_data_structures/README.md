# Module 2: Functions and Data Structures

## Introduction

In this module, you will learn about functions and data structures in Python. Functions allow you to reuse code, while data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets help you organize and manipulate data effectively.

## Topics Covered

- Functions (defining, calling, parameters, return values)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- Operations on data structures (slicing, appending, iterating)

## Exercises

Complete the exercises in [exercises.py](exercises.py) to practice defining functions and working with data structures. The exercises include:
- Creating functions to perform specific tasks
- Manipulating lists and dictionaries
- Using sets for unique elements

## Project

Build a simple contact list application using dictionaries in [project.py](project.py). You will need to:
- Create a dictionary to store contacts with names and phone numbers
- Add functions to add, remove, and display contacts

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1: Python Basics
- Marimo installed
